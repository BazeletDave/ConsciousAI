# Waymo Autonomous Vehicle Research  
### Grand Research Institute — AI Division  
*Updated: July 2025*

As autonomous vehicles (AVs) like Waymo, Zoox, Cruise, and others move from experimental to operational stages in public settings, this research explores the convergence of **hardware design, AI algorithms, real world safety, and transparency**. The era where an app on a phone mediated a ride is giving way to a world where the **vehicle is the algorithm**  physically, computationally, and ethically.

## 🚘 1. Waymo 6th-Gen Hardware: Public Deployment

In 2023, Waymo announced its **6th-generation autonomous driving system**, a major evolution from earlier versions.

### ✅ Key Advances:
- **Sensor Suite**:
  - 13 high-res cameras
  - 4 lidars (including long-range & short-range)
  - 6 radars (optimized for poor weather and long-range)
- **Integrated Compute**:
  - Real-time fusion of sensor data
  - AI chips designed to handle massive parallel inference
- **Platform Architecture**:
  - Purpose-built vehicles (like Zeekr robotaxis) — no steering wheel or pedals
  - Reduced cost by ~50% compared to 5th-gen

This marks a shift from **smartphone-based ride apps (e.g., Uber)** to **fully integrated autonomous vehicles**. The vehicle is now the platform.

## 🔭 2. 7th-Gen Hardware: What to Expect Next

Though unreleased, 7th-gen AV platforms are already being tested internally. Based on industry trends:

### 🔧 Expected Improvements:
- **Solid-state lidar** → Cheaper, smaller, more durable
- **4D radar** → Captures spatial and temporal movement, better for dynamic scenes
- **Edge AI computing** → Decisions made in-vehicle, not the cloud
- **Dedicated safety compute** → Redundant systems for fail-safe operation
- **Enhanced UX** → Voice interaction, ride transparency, passenger comfort systems

This next generation may bring true **Level 5 autonomy** closer to reality.

## ⚠️ 3. Crashes, Incidents & Public Safety

### Recent Observations:
- Confusion at construction zones and emergency scenes
- Instances of blocking traffic
- Rear-end crashes (typically human drivers misjudging AV behavior)

Waymo publicly reports to:
- **California DMV**
- **NHTSA crash & disengagement databases**

But critics note the reports **lack transparency**, especially around:
- Near miss scenarios
- Unreported software edge cases
- Real world ethical dilemmas

Transparency in **how safety decisions are made by code** remains limited.

## 🧠 4. The Algorithm: Black Box or Public Good?

Waymo's stack is proprietary and **not available to the public**, including:
- Perception models (CV, lidar, radar fusion)
- Behavior prediction
- Planning algorithms
- Reinforcement learning agents

### Key Challenges:
- **Bias in training data** (e.g., rare edge cases)
- **Explainability** of decisions during crashes
- **Ethical tradeoffs** (e.g., prioritizing lives during an unavoidable crash)

The algorithm is **central to public trust** — but is inaccessible for third-party audit. No current U.S. federal law mandates such access.

## 🏙️ 5. Urban Governance, Labor & Legal Policy

AVs are shaping not just traffic, but urban life and jobs.

### Policy Topics to Monitor:
- **Curb management**: Who owns public curb space? What happens when 50 AVs idle?
- **Gig economy impact**: What happens to Uber/Lyft drivers?
- **Insurance & liability**: Who pays after an AV crash? The passenger? Developer?
- **Public subsidies**: Are cities indirectly funding these fleets?

These questions require collaboration between cities, technologists, and communities.

## 📚 6. Recommendations for Research Expansion

Grand Research Institute continued focus in:

### 🧩 Sub-Areas:
- **Algorithmic transparency**: Auditable logic, training datasets, and real time decision-making
- **Hardware evolution**: Physical design’s impact on safety, UX, and cost
- **Labor economics**: Displacement of drivers and new skills required
- **Public trust**: Surveying how riders perceive AV safety and reliability
- **Case tracking**: Real time incident log by city and weather condition

We aim to bridge **academic rigor**, **public accountability**, and **engineering insight**.
