# ConsciousAI: A Global Standard for Ethical AI Accountability

**ConsciousAI** is a public, transparent, and globally collaborative platform designed to align artificial intelligence development with universal ethical principles. It is the civic tech implementation of the ideas presented in the book *From Code to Consciousness*, serving as both a toolkit and a forum for ethical AI governance.

## 🌐 Mission
To build the foundational civic infrastructure for ethical AI a platform that invites scientists, ethicists, technologists, policymakers, and communities worldwide to shape the conscience of artificial intelligence.

## 🔑 Core Features

- **Ethics Engine (`core/ethics_engine.py`)**  
  Analyze AI outputs for bias, harm, or ethical misalignment using a transparent, ruleset-driven architecture.

- **Identity Verification (`core/verify_identity.py`)**  
  Authenticate contributors using ORCID, LinkedIn, or academic email to maintain trust and accountability.

- **Living Declaration (`core/declaration.md`)**  
  An open, editable, and version-controlled document establishing global AI ethics principles.

- **AI Transparency Tools (`ai-integration/`)**  
  Audit AI models, check for ideological drift, misalignment, and auto-cite related content from the book.

- **Multilingual Participation (`internationalization/`)**  
  Supports global accessibility and contributions in multiple languages.

- **Governance Framework (`governance/`)**  
  Community-led model inspired by W3C and open-source best practices.

## 📚 Inspired by *From Code to Consciousness*
This platform is an active extension of the manifesto from the book. Each module is mapped to a chapter and includes citation, commentary, and discussion features. Readers can directly influence the ethical declaration and contribute real-world AI case studies.
