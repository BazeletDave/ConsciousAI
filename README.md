# ConsciousAI: A Global Standard for Ethical AI Accountability

**ConsciousAI** is a public, transparent, and globally collaborative platform designed to align artificial intelligence development with universal ethical principles. It is the civic tech implementation of the ideas presented in the book *From Code to Consciousness*, serving as both a toolkit and a forum for ethical AI governance.

## üåê Mission
To build the foundational civic infrastructure for ethical AI a platform that invites scientists, ethicists, technologists, policymakers, and communities worldwide to shape the conscience of artificial intelligence.

## üîë Core Features

- **Ethics Engine (`core/ethics_engine.py`)**  
  Analyze AI outputs for bias, harm, or ethical misalignment using a transparent, ruleset-driven architecture.

- **Identity Verification (`core/verify_identity.py`)**  
  Authenticate contributors using ORCID, LinkedIn, or academic email to maintain trust and accountability.

- **Living Declaration (`core/declaration.md`)**  
  An open, editable, and version-controlled document establishing global AI ethics principles.

- **AI Transparency Tools (`ai-integration/`)**  
  Audit AI models, check for ideological drift, misalignment, and auto-cite related content from the book.

- **Multilingual Participation (`internationalization/`)**  
  Supports global accessibility and contributions in multiple languages.

- **Governance Framework (`governance/`)**  
  Community-led model inspired by W3C and open-source best practices.

## üìö Inspired by *From Code to Consciousness*
This platform is an active extension of the manifesto from the book. Each module is mapped to a chapter and includes citation, commentary, and discussion features. Readers can directly influence the ethical declaration and contribute real world AI cases.

## Conscious AI Framework: Transparency, Truth, and the Future of AI

We are developing an in depth framework exploring the ethics, transparency, and future of AI  anchored by the groundbreaking Swiss AI Initiative and our work at the Grand Research Institute.


This project covers:

- The importance of open source AI models  
- Challenges with current proprietary AI  
- Our Conscious AI framework for ethical AI development  
- Collaborations with students and professors at institutions like Harvard,Thunderbird, and ASU  
- A roadmap for international cooperation and AI governance  

*How AI can serve humanity‚Äôs collective good with transparency and responsibility.*


## üìà Long-Term Vision

- **Ethical Intelligence API** ‚Äî For corporate AI auditing.  
- **Transparency Graph** ‚Äî To visualize algorithmic influence and origin.  
- **Live Policy Tracker** ‚Äî A global dashboard of AI-related legislation.
